# TravelMem
### Overview 
#### Travel experiences sharing application using Python / Flask / MySQL

* The web application is that of a travel memories site that users can share their travel experiences and also discover other users travel experiences that might inspire them to explore a different place in the world. As humans being able to have new experiences is what life is all about. Through this platform you will be able to share your own travel memories by adding your location, writing a vivid description, and adding your most memorable photo of your trip. Being able to describe a travel experience makes that memory much more evocative. The app is meant to be simple that way you are more in tune of your experience rather than get stuck with how many views and likes your memory can attract.

* Utilized one-to-many and many-to-many relationships within MySQL to connect all registered users, allowing for liking posts and adding comments.
* Integrated Open Weather API to view up-to-date weather from the travel locations.
* Implemented Bootstrap for responsive design and styled with HTML5 and CSS for engaging UI components and page layouts.
